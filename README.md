# Project: Create a signup process using Passport
Project from Flavio Copes Bootcamp

## Introduction
Building a sample project we’ll implement a simple authentication workflow using Passport, Node, Sequelize and Postgres.

This is the end result of the project: hitting the app URL will show us a registration page:

Once we register, we’ll access the private area, and we can logout to go back to the signup page.

Once you are logged out, to get back in you’ll need to click the “Login” link and use the other form, because otherwise you’ll get an error (you can’t register 2 times with the same email).
